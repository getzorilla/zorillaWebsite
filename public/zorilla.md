# zorilla, for agents

zorilla runs automations on one person's own machine. An automation is a JSON file:
steps, and wires between them. This file lists every step, what it takes, and the rules
the engine enforces. It is generated from the running catalogue.

Steps: 51. Integrations: 17. Generated 2026-09-10.

For anything this file does not cover, read https://zorilla.io/docs.

## The file

```json
{
  "name": "eth price to discord",
  "folder": "Examples",
  "active": false,
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "clock",
      "type": "core.schedule",
      "params": {
        "mode": "every",
        "every": 10,
        "unit": "minutes"
      },
      "position": {
        "x": 60,
        "y": 200
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "price",
      "type": "coingecko.price",
      "params": {
        "ids": "ethereum",
        "currency": "usd"
      },
      "position": {
        "x": 330,
        "y": 200
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "post",
      "type": "discord.post",
      "params": {
        "credential": "signals_webhook",
        "content": "ETH ${{ $json.ethereum.usd }}"
      },
      "position": {
        "x": 600,
        "y": 200
      }
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "from": "clock",
      "fromPort": "main",
      "to": "price",
      "toPort": "main"
    },
    {
      "from": "price",
      "fromPort": "main",
      "to": "post",
      "toPort": "main"
    }
  ]
}
```

`name` is required. `folder` and `active` are optional: `folder` groups it in the
workspace, `active` decides whether its trigger runs on its own. An imported
automation always arrives with `active` false whatever the file says.

## Rules

- Every step takes a list of items and returns a list of items. An item is `{ "json": { ... } }`, and may also carry `binary` for files.
- A step returning nothing passes its input through. A step returning `[]` passes nothing on, and every step after it is skipped.
- A step that receives no items does not run at all; the log marks it skipped.
- Cycles are refused before a run starts. There is no loop step.
- Exactly one step should have category `trigger`. Without one, nothing starts.
- `{{ ... }}` in any parameter is JavaScript over `$json` (this item), `$items`, `$index`, `$now`, `$creds`.
- A parameter that is only an expression keeps its type: `{{ $json.n * 2 }}` stays a number. A parameter with text around it, or with more than one expression in it, becomes a string.
- A step receives only the keys named on it. `$creds` holds nothing else.
- Amounts from chain steps are integers, handed on as strings. Do not put them through a float.
- Every step may set `retries` (0-5), `retryWait` (milliseconds) and `onError`: `stop`, `continue`, or `errorOutput`. With `errorOutput` the step grows a second port named `error` carrying `{ error, step, at }`.
- Steps that read a list keep asking for pages until they have `limit` items, and say in the log whether more were left.
- Steps whose category is `trigger` and which poll (marked below) fire on their own timer and pass on only what they have not seen before.

## Shapes there is no step for

Two things people ask for often and the engine cannot express. Reach for
`code.js` and say so, rather than looking for a step that is not there.

- **Many items into one.** Nothing collapses a list. `transform.set` runs per item and the `logic.*` steps only drop items. A digest — one email built from twenty stories — has to go through `code.js`.
- **A time of day.** `core.schedule` in `every` mode has no clock: it fires every N minutes, hours or days counted from when it was switched on. `at` belongs to `once` mode, which runs one time and stops. "Every morning at 9" is not expressible.

## Keys

A step names a key; it never carries the value. The person installing it binds that name
to their own saved key. Use plain names like `my_slack`, `signals_webhook`.

## Steps

### action

- **`gmail.send`** (action) — From your Gmail, with an app password. Check Spam and All Mail for the first one.
  - `credential`, credential, a saved gmail key — Gmail key
  - `to`, text — To
  - `subject`, text — Subject
  - `html`, textarea — Message
- **`net.http`** (action) — Calls a URL, passes the response on.
  - `method`, select, default "GET", one of: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE — Method. GET reads, POST sends. The rest are for services that ask for them.
  - `url`, text — URL. The whole address, including https://. Expressions work: .../users/{{ $json.id }}.
  - `credential`, credential — Use a saved key. Adds what the service needs to authenticate. No header to write.
  - `headers`, keyvalue — Extra headers. Anything the service asks for beyond the key, like Accept or a version header.
  - `sendBody`, boolean, default false — Send a body. Off for a GET. On when you are sending something with the request.
  - `bodyType`, select, default "json", one of: json, text, form — Body format. Json for most APIs, form for old ones that want name=value pairs.

## Working examples

### demo04: Contract Event to Telegram

Watches a contract for an event, has Claude say what it means in one line, and sends it to Telegram. Needs a Claude key named claude_key and a Telegram key named telegram_key.

### demo10: Webhook to Slack

Posts to Slack whenever something calls your webhook address. Needs a Slack key named slack_key and a public address.

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "hook",
      "type": "core.webhook",
      "params": {
        "path": "alert",
        "method": "POST"
      },
      "position": {
        "x": 40,
        "y": 170
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "shape",
      "type": "transform.set",
      "params": {
        "fields": [
          {
            "name": "text",
            "value": "{{ $json.body.message ?? 'a test run, with nothing sent in' }}"
          }
        ],
        "keepOnly": true
      },
      "position": {
        "x": 300,
        "y": 170
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "slack",
      "type": "slack.post",
      "params": {
        "credential": "slack_key",
        "channel": "#alerts",
        "text": "{{ $json.text }}"
      },
      "position": {
        "x": 560,
        "y": 170
      }
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "from": "hook",
      "fromPort": "main",
      "to": "shape",
      "toPort": "main"
    },
    {
      "from": "shape",
      "fromPort": "main",
      "to": "slack",
      "toPort": "main"
    }
  ]
}
```

## What it cannot do

- Sign or send a transaction. `web3.prepare` simulates and reports the fee; a person signs.
- Loop or repeat a step. Lists page themselves; nothing else repeats.
- Receive a webhook from the internet without a tunnel, which the app opens on request.
- Cron expressions, or a schedule pinned to a time of day.
